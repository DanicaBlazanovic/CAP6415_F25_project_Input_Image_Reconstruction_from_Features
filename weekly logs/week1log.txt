[WEEK 1 LOG - CV Final Project: Input Image Reconstruction from Features

Project Setup & Research
- Researched feature inversion techniques and read relevant papers
- Reviewed transformer architectures and ViT paper
- Set up GitHub repository and project structure
- Created conda environment and installed dependencies (PyTorch, timm, lpips, scikit-image)

Dataset Preparation
- Downloaded DIV2K dataset (800 train, 100 validation images)
- Implemented dataset loading and preprocessing pipeline
- Created train/val/test split with proper data augmentation
- Verified cross-platform compatibility

Model Architecture Development
- Implemented FeatureExtractor for ResNet34, VGG16, and ViT
- Created attention-based decoder with transformer blocks and self-attention mechanisms
- Configured multi-architecture feature extraction pipeline

Training & Evaluation Pipeline
- Implemented complete training loop with MSE loss
- Set up Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- Added checkpoint saving and validation monitoring
- Implemented metrics calculator (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, MSE)
- Created proper denormalization and metric computation protocol

Experiment Automation
- Built automated experiment runner for multi-layer testing
- Set up results directory structure and CSV logging
- Created visualization scripts for reconstruction comparisons
- Implemented summary report generation

Experiments Completed
- ResNet34: 4 layers tested
- VGG16: 5 blocks tested (block1 required Google Colab Pro A100 GPU)
- ViT: 5 blocks tested
- Total: 14 experiments across three architectures

Analysis & Documentation
- Created comprehensive README with methodology and results
- Documented cross-architecture comparison and findings
- Added hardware specifications and training details
- Generated reconstruction visualizations for all experiments
- Set up DVC for large file management

Week 1 Summary
Total experiments: 14 across three architectures
Code written: ~2000 lines across 8 modules and 3 scripts
Deliverable: Complete feature inversion pipeline with evaluation
