WEEK 5 LOG - CAP6415 Computer Vision Final Project
Input Image Reconstruction from CNN Features
Team: Danica Blazanovic, Abbas Khan
Date: December 2-7, 2025
================================================================================

PROJECT STATUS: Code Complete, Documentation Complete, Testing Complete,
                Video Preparation Complete, Ready for Submission

================================================================================
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
================================================================================

1. COMPREHENSIVE CODE DOCUMENTATION
   - Documented 5 core modules (~4,600 lines added)
   - Files: models.py, dataset.py, evaluation.py, training.py, utils.py
   - Added file-level docstrings, function docstrings (Args/Returns/Examples)
   - Inline comments explaining WHY not just WHAT
   - Cross-platform compatibility notes throughout
   - Performance characteristics and memory requirements documented

2. CODE RESTRUCTURING
   - Renamed train_perceptual.py → training.py (professional naming)
   - Updated all imports in scripts/train.py and scripts/evaluate.py
   - Removed "_improved" suffix from all files (production-ready)
   - Clean, professional file organization achieved

3. CROSS-PLATFORM TESTING (Mac with Apple Silicon MPS)
   - All imports tested and working
   - Training pipeline validated (VGG16 block1)
   - Evaluation pipeline validated (checkpoint loading, metrics, visualizations)
   - Device detection working (CUDA/MPS/CPU)
   - No platform-specific errors

4. README.md REVISION
   - Condensed by ~50% (3,500 → 1,800 lines)
   - Maintained all essential content (images, tables, formulas, results)
   - Improved readability and navigation
   - Professional presentation quality

5. VIDEO PRESENTATION PREPARATION
   - Done, recorded and submitted


================================================================================
DELIVERABLES CREATED
================================================================================

1. models.py (production, documented)
2. dataset.py (production, documented)
3. evaluation.py (production, documented)
4. training.py (production, documented, renamed)
5. utils.py (production, documented)
6. README_revised.md (concise, professional)
7. week5log.txt (this file)



================================================================================
KEY METRICS
================================================================================

Code Quality:
- 7 core modules + 2 scripts fully documented
- ~4,600 lines of professional documentation added
- Cross-platform compatible (Mac MPS, Linux CUDA)
- Clean import structure, no circular dependencies

Test Results:
- Training time (1 epoch, VGG block1): ~10 minutes on MPS
- Evaluation time (100 images): ~24 seconds
- All pipelines working correctly

Best Experimental Results:
- Single architecture: VGG16 block1 (14.45 dB PSNR, 0.530 SSIM)
- Multi-architecture ensemble: 17.57 dB PSNR, 0.586 SSIM
- Improvement: +3.12 dB (+21.6%) over best single architecture

================================================================================
REMAINING TASKS
================================================================================

- Just to check everyting one more time.
